# TODO
- Check figures and tables for positioning and make sure its at the bottom or top of a page
- Improve thesis statement of Chapter 2
- Add something about scan to the end of Chapter 2 and about area penalty (First half of chapter 2 maybe?)
- Add something related to the statement that we are doing this as a comparison to traditional approaches (Say at the end of Chapter 4?)
