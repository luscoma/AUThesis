# Sources
- Source which defines a netlist
- Something about an atpg
- Something that discusses parallel fault simulation using an integer data type

# TODO
- Citations, o dear lord at the citations needed
- Review grammer int he first half, we will start BIST architecture Sunday hopefully..
- Consider defining fault coverage early?
- Expand on potential detection
- Consder editing the potential fault coefficent setence, its bad

# Fault Simulations
- The sentence defining a netlist needs to be better, a source should clear this problem up
- Potential continuation of opening paragraph: Referring back to Section \ref{sct:basictesting}, each test vector input is applied to the inputs of the circuit during simulation and the output recorded\cite{needed-faultsim}.  
- Research strouds take on transistor model, potentially change setence of the advantage of transistor model
