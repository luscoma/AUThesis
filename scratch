Regardless of these disadvantages, this test procedure does have a significant number of advantages compared to other methods.  It is circuit agnostic and can be applied to a number of mixed-signal BIST setups since it only requires a post-layout Verilog model for the conversion process and a digital loopback path for testing purposes.  So while development of the test vector set must occur iteratively, it can be fine-tuned for the specific architecture being tested and intuitively evolved.  In addition by utilizing this method of testing no performance penalty and little area overhead is incurred in the circuit.  This is a significant advantage compared to many other BIST techniques which require additional circuitry to be included in the circuit which in some cases can negatively affect system performance and increases chip area.  In the discussed procedure all testing is performed using the digital loopback path and no dedicated test circuitry must be inserted into critical path ways.  This means that the testing of the BIST can be performed at system speed and without the need for external test equipment.  Furthermore this allows for testing of the BIST at all stages of the product life cycle including during the manufacturing process and at any time during in-system operation such as before being used to make measurements in the analog portion of a mixed-signal system.
