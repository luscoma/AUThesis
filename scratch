# TODO
- Fix the photo of the bist architecture, its not even right oO
- Replace the clock cycle or-chain with a custom picture thats more detailed, probably labeled number of clock cycles on output and the oring of all frequency words on input.  If possible also show the clock cycle counter
- Also don't forget the DDS picture
