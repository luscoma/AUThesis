# This is the ideas and thoughts section
# Hopefully this will keep my ideas straight
- We should give a few examples of testing analog circuits
- Same goes for digital
- If possible a reference for mixed-signal would be good too
- Analog: we should say that addingin components can affect the response of the analog components so that it ties into our sentence about no interferance in mixed signal
- Analog: find a source on resonant frequency testing
- Analog: verify the description of catastrophic faults which I give, its pretty shoddy line 173ish
- Perhaps tie in that by using the mixed bist to test itself less only a single bist has to be put into a system and verified

# TODO
- Fix the stuff about signatures
- Change zorians thing
- add remaining sources

# References Needed
- Need a reference about a simple method of defect-oriented testing and its challenges
